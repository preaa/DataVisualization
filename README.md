A project for Udacity submission
Data Exploration of Bay Wheels System Dataset
by Prerna Bhand

# Dataset

The BayWheels Dataset (Formerly called as Ford GoBike Dataset) is a collection of trips from various drivers from several years. This project is based on dataset from 2019. https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels/system-data. The dataset is also found here - https://s3.amazonaws.com/baywheels-data/index.html
This dataset consists in a set of information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system around the area of San Francisco city. The goal for Bay Wheels is offering a fun and economical way of going through the city for two blocks or 2 miles. About this system, Bay Wheels (previously Ford GoBike), is a bike-sharing system with different types of subscriptions: you can ride just one time, for a day or have unlimited rides, of course with different pricing for each subscription. They have lots of bicycle types, even electric ones, to attend every consumer needs.

The dataset logs following important points from the users that proved pivotal to the analysis. 
1. Ride Duration
2. Ride Start and End Time
3. Ride Start and End Stations in Lattitude and Longitude
4. User types - Customer or Subscribers


# Summary of Findings

This project aims to explore and analyse the BayWheels dataset to understand usage patterns from users, general insights about rides for example their duration, or common starting/ending points, and their usage through the week. 

The data variables explained above will be used for analysis and visualization.



## Important Questions for Exploration

The analysis tries to find answers to following questions by using the important data points mentioned earlier.

### 1. How many rides are taken through the week ? Is there a diffeence between weekday and weekend?
### 2. What is average ride durations? Again, does it change for weekday and weekend?
### 3. Do users with different subcription model - Customers or Subscribers have different usage pattern in terms of number of rides or their duration?

## Findings

After the analysis, following insights were observed. However, since we do not have all the data or other important data points, the observations are only insights or hints, that need to be confirmed or further explored with other data points that are not available with this data set. 

### Observation 1

The number of rides were higher on weekdays, however the ride durations were higher on weekends, indicating that users are engaging in leisure trips on weekends that probably last longer as compared to regular work trips that are being taken during the work-week.

### Observation 2
User types - customers and subcribers have different usage pattern. Subscribers use the rides in a consistent manner and use more for their work-trips every day. Customers do not have such higher count of rides during the work-week but their ride durations are higher than subcribers during the weekend. It appears customers are using the bikes more for their leisure journes, and subscribers are preferring for their regular office trips. Again this observation is limited to the data we have and hence cannot be applied widely. 



## Key Insights for Presentation

The presentation and analyiss focused on the above mentioned questions and finding out observations through the data analysis and visualization techniques that I learned from this course.

For polishing the graphs, I used general techniques that I learned from the course and used the graphs that were important to present the analysis.

I referred to Udacity Support forum with questions and answers to understand the data set and perfrom the analysis. I also referred to StackOverflow for some of technical questions. Overall I found the data set to be complex and challenging, and certainly there is more room to refine the analysis and visualization.
